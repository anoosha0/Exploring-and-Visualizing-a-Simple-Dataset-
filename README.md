🌸 Iris Dataset Exploration 

This project is part of my Data Analysis internship. The goal is to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset to understand the dataset's structure, visualize feature distributions, and explore relationships between variables.

📌 Objective

- Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis.
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships using plotting techniques.
- Identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers.
- Build a foundational understanding of EDA.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the built-in Iris dataset available via Seaborn. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample has 4 features:

| Feature        | Description         |
|----------------|---------------------|
| sepal_length   | Sepal length in cm  |
| sepal_width    | Sepal width in cm   |
| petal_length   | Petal length in cm  |
| petal_width    | Petal width in cm   |

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas – for data manipulation and summary
- Seaborn – for built-in dataset and elegant plots
- Matplotlib – for general visualizations

📊 Visualizations Included

- Scatter Plot: Sepal Length vs Sepal Width (colored by species)
- Histograms: Feature-wise distribution for all 4 numeric columns
- Box Plots: Outlier detection and feature comparison across species

🔍 Key Insights

- Setosa species are easily separable based on petal features.
- Sepal dimensions overlap more between Versicolor and Virginica.
- Box plots revealed possible outliers and distribution shapes.
- The dataset is well-balanced with no missing values.

🧠 What I Learned

- How to load and inspect datasets using pandas.
- The importance of understanding data before applying models.
- Effective use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for visual storytelling.
- EDA helps in building hypotheses for further analysis or ML.
